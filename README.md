# Subgraph Patterns within an Auction Enviroment

In this repository, you will find all of the technical work completed here. This consists of cypher queries to gather the data along with Python files which were used for the analysis of the data that was gathered. 

The bulk of this work was a research paper which was written using the scripts in this file. The auction network was used to draw all of the necessary figures for each team which aided the process of analyzing the bid patterns for all the teams within an auction.
